## Hybrid Sorting Algorithm Starter Files

#### Teaching Assistant Project I made for CSE 331 @ MSU


The pplication solution only is provided in DoublyLinkedList.py. 

count_unique:

Takes a linked list and condenses it to represent the unique elements with the count of that element
        proceeding it. When an element occurs once, do not supply the value of its count.
        
Examples:
            input:  a->a->a->b->b->c->c->d
            output: a->3->b->2->c->2->d->1
            
            input:  d->c->a->a->b->c->b->d
            output: a->2->b->2->c->2->d->2
            
            input: a->a->a->a->a->a->a->a->a->a->a->a->b
            output: a->1->2->b 
            
            
Other solution files and additional hidden test cases are withheld as this project is still in use within the curriculum.
